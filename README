Textmate Bundle for RSpec plain text stories

Features:
  * Color highlighting for plain text stories
    * Themes that have been modified to take advantage of this can be found in color_themes/
  * Simple snippets for plain text stories and scenarios
  * Predefined completions (escape key) for common story keywords
  * Spellchecking turned on by default for the plaintext stories
  * Run the current plain text story and display in HTML (see caveats)

Caveats about running stories:
  * Requires edge rspec (not 1.1.3)
  * Currently, the running of stories relies on the following directory structure:
     /project_root/stories
		   |-feature_one
		   |--- some_story.rb
		   |---stories
		   |----- some_story.story (extension does not matter)
			 |-feature_two
			 |....
		So, the story runner file needs to be in the directory below the stories dir for that feature.
		

TODO:
  * Make running a story more robust to work with any configuration.
  * Run All Stories command.
  * Run Selected Stories command.
  * Switch Command
		* Easily switch between a plain text story and it's runner ruby file.
		* Switch between story and it's specific step matcher file.
  * Step Navigation
    * Be able to quickly navigate to the step files that are being used for the current story.
