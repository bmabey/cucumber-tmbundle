Textmate Bundle for RSpec plain text stories

Features:
  * Color highlighting for plain text stories
    * Themes that have been modified to take advantage of this can be found in color_themes/
  * Snippets for plain text stories and step files.  Include story keywords plus webrat snippets.
  * Predefined completions (escape key) for common story keywords.
  * Spellchecking turned on by default for the plaintext stories.
  * Run the current plain text story and display in HTML.  Clickable backtrace and all.
  * Switch between plain text story and corresponding step matcher file.
  * Automatically create template step file with pending steps based on the steps used in the story.

Caveats:
  * Requires RSpec 1.1.4
  * The running of stories and file switching relies on the following directory structure convention:
     Basic stories (no sub-directories):
     
       /project_root/stories
   		   |- basic_story.rb
   		   |- stories
   		   |   |- basic_story.story (extension must be .story)
   		   |
   		   |- steps
   		       |- basic_story_steps.rb
     
     Using feature sub-directories:
     
       /project_root/stories
  		   |- feature_one
  		   |   |- some_story.rb
  		   |   |- stories
  		   |   |   |- some_story.story (extension must be .story)
  		   |   |
  		   |   |- steps
  		   |       |- some_story_steps.rb
  		   |
  		   |- feature_two
  		   | .....
  	
  	These directory structures can be used together (basic stories can reside in the root stories directory, and feature sets can be put in sub directories).
		

TODO:
  * Run All Stories command.
  * Run Selected Stories command.
  * (MAYBE) Make running a story more robust to work with any configuration.
  * Refactor to make cleaner and add more specs.


  
TODONE:		
  * Improve HTML output to show failing information.
  * If in story file, and step file doesn't exist, and going to specific step - make snippets work correctly
      - currently inserts new step and tag name of step file - steps_for(:Given "blah blah" ...)
  * When in step file - if doing SHIFT-CTRL-OPTION-DOWN - go to first step that match
  * Switch Command
		* Easily switch between a plain text story and it's runner ruby file.
  * Step Navigation
    * Be able to quickly navigate to the step files that are being used for the current story.
    * Automatically go to the selected step or create it if it does not exist.
